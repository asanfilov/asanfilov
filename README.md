### 💬 About me

Hi, I am Alex. As a software developer, I am passionate about my craft and eager to learn and grow. 
I enjoy contributing in a truly Agile team with a DevOps mindset, where we build impactful software products using modern technologies and best practices. 
I especially value environments with frequent deployments, minimal drama, and strong collaboration.
I have a Master's degree in Global Software Development from a German university. 

Since 2018, I've specialized in developing back-end applications using .NET (C#), SQL Server, REST APIs, Azure Functions and Azure Storage. 
More recently, I've expanded my skills to include professional WPF development.
